## Deepseek hype

Deepseek just came out and I can not believe the hype. Hence I made a test script to see how it performs.

## How to use?

This is an extremly simple and easy to understand code. Adjust it then use:

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Model power
I do not have a power PC. If someone has, feel free do the tests with larger models and trickier prompts.
